**Discover effective techniques and design patterns for every programming task**

## What is this book about?
TypeScript offers a rich type system that can be used to enhance the existing JavaScript code. This book will cover all the classical design patterns in TypeScript and their primary categories using practical examples and class diagrams for each of the design patterns.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the role of design patterns and their significance
* Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript
* Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts
* Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice
* Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming
* Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them

  sendEvent(action: string): void {
    console.log("Event Created: ", action);
  }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful.
